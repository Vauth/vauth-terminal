## üé® Customization
### Styling
The design uses CSS custom properties for easy theming. Key variables are defined in `src/index.css`:

```css
:root {
  --glass-bg: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
  --glass-border: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
  --text-primary: #ffffff;
  --text-secondary: #e5e5e5;
  /* ... more variables */
}
```

### Terminal Commands
Add new commands by extending the `executeCommand` function in `src/components/NativeTerminal.tsx`:

```typescript
case 'your-command':
  addLine('output', 'Your command output here');
  break;
```

### File System
Modify the file system structure in the `fileSystem` object:

```typescript
const fileSystem: Record<string, FileSystemItem[]> = {
  '/home/vauth': [
    { name: 'your-file.txt', type: 'file', size: 1024 },
    // ... more files
  ],
};
```
